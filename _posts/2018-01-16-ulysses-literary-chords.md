Two of my favorite classes at Princeton were ENG 324: James Joyce's *Ulysses* and MUS 105/106: Music Theory. One of my goals is to re-read *Ulysses*, and the final paper I wrote for ENG 324 will always be a reminder of why. In case the original essay gets lost in the hard drives, I'm posting it [here](/files/ulysses_literary_chords.pdf) for easy access.
