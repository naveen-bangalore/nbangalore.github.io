We introduce a perceptually motivated approach to bandwidth expansion for speech. Our method pairs a new three-way split variant of the [FFTNet](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Jin_2018_FAR/index.php) neural vocoder structure with a perceptual loss function, combining objectives from both the time and frequency domains. Mean opinion score tests show that it outperforms baseline methods from both domains, even for extreme bandwidth expansion.
