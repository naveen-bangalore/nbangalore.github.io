Hey there! I'm a Senior Camera Engineer at HP Inc's Video Engineering team. Before joining HP Inc, I was a researcher at Hitachi America R&D, where i worked on 2D and 3D perception for various AD/ADAS applications. And I completed my master's degree at San Jose State University, specializing in Electrical Engineering.
My current interest lies in computer vision challenges involving 3D Perception, scene understanding and multimodal sensor fusion and image stitching
