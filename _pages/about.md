Hey there! I'm a second-year PhD student at Caltech working with [Prof. Katie Bouman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/) in the [Computing & Mathematical Sciences](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/) Department. Previously, I studied computer science at Princeton University. I'm interested in computer vision and physics-based machine learning.
